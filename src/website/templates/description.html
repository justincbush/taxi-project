            <h4>The Basic Problem</h4>
            There are two obvious factors that determine how quickly a taxi can take you
            between two points in New York City. First, wherever you are starting you have 
            to find an available cab; then once you've found one you have to make your way 
            through traffic to your destination.
            <br><br>
            From <a href="http://chriswhong.com/open-data/foil_nyc_taxi/">a publicly 
            available dataset</a>, we have detailed information about every taxi trip 
            taken in New York City during 2013. In particular we have the latitude and longitude 
            coordinates as well as the precise time for the beginning and end of each of the
            more than 170 million trips. The goal of this project is to use this data to 
            give useful information both about the difficulty of finding a cab, and the 
            time it will take to actually drive wherever you're going.
            
            <h4>Cab Availability</h4>
            
            The heatmaps to the right represent how easy it is to find a cab in different
            parts of New York at different times, with darker shaded areas being better
            places to look for a cab. But there is nothing in the data
            about how long people were waiting before they hailed a cab (or how 
            many people gave up looking completely), so how were these maps constructed?
            
            We do have data telling us how many taxis picked up
            passengers in each part of the city during a given hour. This gives us some
            measure of the number of cabs in a given area, but obviously this is not enough
            information to draw any conclusions about how easy it will be to find a cab. 
            Perhaps there are lots of taxis picking people up in an area because there
            are so many people looking for rides, and most people looking give up in
            frustration. At the same time, having more taxis in an area is better is
            better than having very few, in general.

            <h4>Estimating Trip Times</h4>
            
            Let's first take the more straightforward problem of estimating trip times 
            between different locations in the city at a particular time and day of the
            week. The basic approach is to divide the city up into a grid based on latitude 
            and longitude coordinates. There is a careful balance to strike here, between
            making the grid small enough to get as detailed information as possible, while
            large enough to ensure there are a meaningful number of trips between grid
            elements. Using the whole city as one big grid element is boring and 
            uninformative, while using a grid that's just a few feet across means you 
            won't have any similar trips to use in comparison.
            <br><br>
            
            For the taxi data, the grid that gave the best tradeoff was 1/50 of a degree 
            on each side. This is still fairly large---larger than a small Manhattan
            neighborhood, for instance. So directly reporting the distribution of trip
            times between two grid elements still might not be very informative. But we
            can actually do better than that. While we might expect a trip starting several
            blocks away and going to the same destination to take a different amount of
            time, we might be more willing to expect it to go at roughly the same speed.
            From this observation, we can see that what we really want to keep track
            of are the distributions of speeds (and not times) between different parts of 
            the city. Given that we know the distance of our trip, once we know the 
            distribution of speeds we can infer the distribution of times.
